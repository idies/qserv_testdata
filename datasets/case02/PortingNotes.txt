Notes when porting data and queries to mssql-data and mssql-queries.
...

Porting table DDLs is quite straightforward.

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS <table name> may work in MSSQL 2016, otherwise use 

IF OBJECT_ID('dbo.Object', 'U') IS NOT NULL
 DROP TABLE dbo.Object;
GO 


Type mapping:
double->float
float->real
tintint(4)->tinyint and similar for int(11), bigint(20)

KEY statement at end turned into create index statement.

-- Porting queries:
0003 has a USING clause in a JOIN. Need to use "ON s.objectId=o.objectId" instead.
0006.FIXME has non-existent columns, uses parameters (:objectId), uses spDist function (to be ported)
1002.1 needs porting scisql_fluxToAbMag (DONE). Has special feature "withQserv" that may be used by multi-node qserv to send query to appropriate node???
1002.2 use spherical library for point-in-circle query
1002.3 no analogue in spherical library for point-in-ellipse query (?)
